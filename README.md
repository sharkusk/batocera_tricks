# Batocera Tips and Tricks

This is a place for the various tips and tricks I'm using for my Batocera Arcade machine.

So far there are entries to help:

1 How to configure Batocera to use a pre-2015 IPAC/IPAC-Mini arcade controller (with Batocera version 41).
1 Modified mouse-fix.sh script to support both trackballs and spinners (spinner specific games must be specified at the top of the script).
